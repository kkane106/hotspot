== Hotspot

Production: http://hotspotapp.herokuapp.com/

We aim to foster a one-stop shop for code reviewers to go to while looking over others' code.  We plan to create a page that displays the file path, the number of commits, and the users that have committed to that certain file.

Our goal is not to replace Github's functionality, but enhance it for code reviewers. By evaluating where the bulk of recent activity has been on a project, reviewers will be able to focus their attention where it will be the most helpful without having to search through every file in a project to find what is the most important.
